## Abstract
Reconstructing 3D coronary arteries is important for coronary artery disease diagnosis, treatment planning and operation navigation. Traditional reconstruction techniques often require many projections, while reconstruction from sparse-view X-ray projections is a potential way of reducing radiation dose. However, the extreme sparsity of coronary arteries in a 3D volume and ultra-limited number of projections pose significant challenges for efficient and accurate 3D reconstruction. To this end, we propose 3DGR-CAR, a 3D Gaussian Representation for Coronary Artery Reconstruction from ultra-sparse X-ray projections. We leverage 3D Gaussian representation to avoid the inefficiency caused by the extreme sparsity of coronary artery data and propose a Gaussian center predictor to overcome the noisy Gaussian initialization from ultra-sparse view projections. The proposed scheme enables fast and accurate 3D coronary artery reconstruction with only 2 views. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other methods in terms of voxel accuracy and visual quality of coronary arteries.
